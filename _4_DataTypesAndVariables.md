## How to declare the variables

- `int rollno =10;`
- `char group = 'A';`
- `float price = 12.75f;` Remember writting 'f' is necessary otherwise, the compiler will treat it as 'double'

**Note:** Refer the program in the .cpp files to see how different variables are being used.

## Invalid variable names

Some examples:

| Valid        | Invalid      |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| int x1;      | int 1x;      |
| int rollno;  | int roll no; |
| int roll_no; | int rollNo;  |

**Note:** Refer the program in the .cpp files to see how different variables are being name.

**Note:** Always use meaningful names for your variables.
